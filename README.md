# Prime Gym

Making my first project ever this has been my harderst task by far and most effort taking but i wanted to make Prime Gym visually simple and nothing hard to navigate.

Websites with lots of navigation is sometimes to hard to go through you end up loosing what you are looking for.

# UX 

This website is for people who love the gym and who have a passion making there body and mind fitter, And for the casuals who enjoy the social
side of it.

The website is made from 6 diffrent pages all with diffrent context.

# Features 

I have a few features on my page including a Sign up box and a Join now box. However there not live. I got the header and Footer of a website and will credit them later down in the README.

I wanted to create my website but not to be tasking to read and look at thats why there isnt alot of context or information within my website. I wanted to keep the information simple as it is a gym website and not an Wiki Page.





 I have used bootstrap for using my .cols to get the proper look for mobile. I have images on my laptop of a preview but im not sure how to do it at this time.
